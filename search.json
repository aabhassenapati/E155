    "text": "Design and Testing Methodology\nI designed three modules in Verilog to implement my hardware on the FPGA, where my top module interfaces with the modules that drive builtin leds and seven segment display. In my led builting module, I used a counter to divide my clock signal from 24Mhz to 2.4 Hz, meanwhile for the other two leds based on the truth table, i implemented the outputs to leds as XOR and AND gates respectively. In the seven segment module I wrote the case based switching based on switch inputs to drive the leds on seven segment, that implements it as combinational logic. I calculated my resistor values by doing Vdd-Vf(led)=IR, i.e. 3.3V - 2.1V = IR, and tried to limit my current below 8mAmps, for convinience I used the 162 Ohm resistor, which satisfies this requirement, as current flowing should be around 7.4 mAmps. The implementation was tested with simulation testbenches on Questa, and also verified on actual hardware built as shown below, using the schematics."

I spent like approximately 15 hours on this lab. I also found it helpful to work on the testbenches to test my implementation of the hardware."

I confirmed the design its the RTL syntehsis and it seemed good to me. I think it kind of shows that AI is a really powerful tool to use in hardware related projects, especially if used by a person how these things piece together and work, which helps in better interacting with I model and the prompts.\n\n\n\nFig. n: RTL synthesis for AI generated Code"

    "text": "MicroPs is a class that I had been looking forward to since almost a year ago when I took E85, especially because I have been very passionate about building hardware and electornics projects with IoT. While I have worked with embedded systems before, I don’t think I before coming to Mudd, I got the actual understanding of how the libraries or even the actual microprocessors worked, I just knew how to use them to do what I need to do, without acutally understanding their actual mechanism. I feel like one of my goals from this course, is to be able to get that in-depth understanding of the working of microcontroller, especially after having taken E85, and also build fun projects, that involves application of my skills. I am looking forward to also take-up a project that will involve my understanding of microprocessors, and apply it to do a project which is intersectional, and can be possibly used in ecological sensing. I am also not taking a lot of classes this semester, so that I can focus on quality over quantity, and get good grasp over what I learn and also enjoy this process. Looking forward to what this course and semester entails."
